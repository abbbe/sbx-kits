# THE EXTENSION MUST STAY DISABLED.  Installing jupyter-mcp-server into this
# venv auto-enables a Jupyter server extension -- the wheel ships a file into
# etc/jupyter/jupyter_server_config.d/ and there is no opt-in step.  With it
# loaded the MCP tools run in JUPYTER_SERVER mode, where a cell write rewrites
# the .ipynb on disk whenever the notebook is not currently open in a browser,
# behind RTC's back.  Two layers of defense: the kit's install step overwrites
# the shipped config.d file with an explicit disable, and this script passes
# the disable flag as well.  Measured: /mcp returns 404 with the flag set.
#
# RTC STATE STAYS IN THE CONTAINER, NEVER ON THE BIND MOUNT.  Both paths below
# are absolute and under /home/agent, which is overlay: they survive stop/start
# together and die with `sbx rm` together.  Splitting their lifetimes is what
# corrupts notebooks (jupyter_server_ydoc rebuilds rooms from disk with a
# hardcoded Doc(client_id=0); a stale peer plus a rebuilt room is an identity
# collision, not a merge).  Absolute paths also mean the working directory no
# longer decides where the ystore lands.

# Launch from the workspace so the server process cwd IS the notebook root.

# JupyterLab *terminal* inherits the server process cwd when the frontend

# in /home/agent/workspace, an unrelated image dir.  Without this cd a

# BASH, NOT sh, IN JUPYTERLAB TERMINALS.  jupyter_server_terminals picks the
# shell with `[os.environ.get("SHELL") or which("sh")]` -- it never reads the
# user's passwd entry, so `agent` having /bin/bash there buys nothing.  This
# script is launched by sbx's detached startup dispatcher, which exports no
# SHELL, so the fallback wins and every terminal opens /bin/sh.  Both lines
# below are wanted; they fix different halves:
#
#   - terminado_settings pins what the server spawns, independently of the
#     environment this script happened to be started with;
#   - SHELL is inherited by that shell and by its children, so $SHELL inside
#     the terminal is right too (bash does not set it -- login(1) normally
#     would), which is what anything spawning "the user's shell" consults.
#
# An explicit shell_command suppresses upstream's own `-l` append (it only adds
# that when it had to guess the shell AND stdout is not a tty, both true here),
# so `-l` is spelled out to keep that behaviour: a login shell sources
# /etc/profile and ~/.profile, which is where the PATH that finds `claude`
# comes from.
